# 200 - The Start Page

Once you've studied the tutorials, you can decide on your next step with the help of the Start Page:

- If you want additional guidance, or you want to accelerate your data preparation and model building, try [Turbo Prep](https://docs.rapidminer.com/latest/studio/guided/turbo-prep/), RapidMiner's tool for interactive data preparation, and [Auto Model](https://docs.rapidminer.com/latest/studio/guided/auto-model/), RapidMiner's solution for automated machine learning.
- If you want to see more examples, choose from one of the templates in the [Samples Repository](https://docs.rapidminer.com/latest/studio/getting-started/studio-samples.html).
- If you want to do it yourself, create a new (blank) process from scratch in the [Design View](https://docs.rapidminer.com/latest/studio/getting-started/design-view.html).

You can open the Start Page at any time by selecting ```File``` > ```New Process```.
