# 200 - The Start Page

Once you've studied the tutorials, you can decide on your next step with the help of the Start Page:

If you want additional guidance, or you want to accelerate your data preparation and model building, try Turbo Prep, RapidMiner's tool for interactive data preparation, and Auto Model, RapidMiner's solution for automated machine learning.
If you want to see more examples, choose from one of the templates in the Samples Repository.
If you want to do it yourself, create a new (blank) process from scratch in the Design View.
You can open the Start Page at any time by selecting File > New Process.
