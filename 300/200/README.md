# 200 - Getting Started

Based on "Getting started with RapidMiner Studio" at https://docs.rapidminer.com/latest/studio/getting-started/

Probably the best way to learn how to use RapidMiner Studio is the hands-on approach: Download RapidMiner Studio, and study the [bundled tutorials](https://docs.rapidminer.com/latest/studio/getting-started/#tutorials). Once you've looked at the tutorials, follow one of the suggestions provided on the [Start Page](https://docs.rapidminer.com/latest/studio/getting-started/#start). Here are some additional hints:

- For a hands-on introduction to the user interface, read about the [Design View](https://docs.rapidminer.com/latest/studio/getting-started/design-view.html).
- For training videos, check out [RapidMiner Academy](https://academy.rapidminer.com/).
- For basic data science tutorials, see the series [5 minutes with Ingo](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLssWC2d9JhOZZ6PCzJt2L2zUwA3RozrP_).
