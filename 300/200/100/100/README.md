## 1/5 - Welcome to RapidMiner.

RapidMiner Studio has a lot of features to offer. In the next few minutes, you will learn how you can use RapidMiner Studio to perform basic data science techniques, such as: accessing data, transforming data, and building statistical models. We will use data describing the Titanic passengers.

### Explanation

Each tutorial is broken into several steps to teach you the basics of RapidMiner Studio. Each step lists specific actions to perform, plus an explanation of why those actions matter. Notice the dotted-line preview in the **Process** Panel; this shows you the process you will be building in that tutorial.

## 2/5 - Retrieve data.

Let's start by retrieving some data about the Titanic passengers.

2. ```Open``` the folders **Samples** and then **data**.
3. ```Drag``` the **Titanic Training** dataset and ```drop``` it in the **Process** panel in the middle of the screen.

### Explanation

Good job! You have just added your first operator to RapidMiner Studio, namely the **Retrieve** Operator. Operators perform actions: in this case, it retrieves data from the **Repository**. Now let's see what you can do with it!
